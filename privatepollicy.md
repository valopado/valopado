<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<li>We collect data that includes user IDs, server IDs, channel IDs.</li>
<li>The Squirrel Bot service also stores data about message IDs, but we will not store them in our database.</li>
We do not ask for any personal information of users regarding passwords, e-mail and the like.</li>
The data is stored in the Squirrel service until the server administration kicks it out or deletes it from the server. You can also delete your data by writing a request on our technical support server.</li>
<li> Access to Data is only permitted to Bot's developers, and only in the scope required for the development, testing, and implementation of features for Bot.

<h2>I would like to repeat if you do not want the bot to record any information:</h2>
<li> Submit a request to the technical support server to delete entries in the database.</li>
<li> Contact the bot developers using feedback commands.</li>
<li> Or just write your problem to the creator of the bot in private messages</li>
